3. To run my project, you must have python 2 and numpy installed.
All the class files like KnowledgeBase, Model, Sentence, etc. must be in the main directory.

The first mandatory part is modus ponens. Both the Truth Table Enumeration and the WalkSat are done in modus.py. So run python modus.py
The second mandatory part is Simple Wumpus. Both parts are in wumpus.py. Run python wumpus.py
The third mandatory part that is more advanced is Unicorn. Run python unicorn.py.
The first extra credit is Liars. Part A of liars is python LiarsA.py. Part B of liars is python LiarsB.py.
The second extra credit is Liars Anonymous Group. Run python LiarsGroup.py.
